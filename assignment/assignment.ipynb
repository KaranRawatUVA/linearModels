        "\n",
        "2. The coefficient for a dummy variable represents how much it increases the y when the observation has that trait. So, it is the difference between having that variable and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Technically yes, but it wouldn't be good because it is limited in its tools to deal with outliers. We've seen graphs where everything is so spread apart (which would be nice for classification) and the line doesn't describe the graph right at all. Also, its more continuous.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. A sign that my graph is overfitting is when there is high variance. The graph will bend in weird ways to incorprate all the test data, but in reality there just will be outliers sometimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Multi-colinearity is when you have indendent variables that are related to eachother. In two-stage least squares technique this is checked when the first stage checks the endogenous variables and the second variable regresses the dependent variable on the predicted values. So two-stage least squares combats multi-colinearity by reducing its effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. You can do this by adding variables that are just the same variable but with non-linear function effecting it. Ex: var -> var^2 or log(var). This would keep it linear but still add non linear elements. Also, to add independent variables like features/control is to make it into a dummy variable (True/False)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. An intercept can be interpretated as the starting point, so when all the variables are 0, then the y is that. A slope coefficient is the the rate that y increases when that x increases. The coefficient of a dummy variable represents the average increase to the y when it is true."

        "**Q5.** This is a question about linear regression. The outcome is whether a defendant is held pre-trial in the Virginia justice system. We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",

        "  - `race`, `sex`: Categorical demographic variables\n",
        "  - `is_poor`: Whether the defendant is classified as indigent\n",
        "  - `prior_F`, `prior_M`: The number of prior felony and misdemeanor arrests\n",
        "  - `case_type`: A categorical variable indicating a misdemeanor `M` or felony `F` or infraction `I` or special case `S`\n",
        "  - `age`: Defendant's age\n",
        "  - `bond`, `bond_NA`, `bond_type`: The amount of any bond, whether it is missing, and the type\n",
        "  - `sentence`, `sentence_NA`, `sentence_type`: The length of any sentence, whether it is missing, and the type\n",

        "1. Load the `pretrial_data.csv` data. Notice that there are `nan`s, but the data are relatively clean. Because there are `.nan`s among variables you won't use, you'll want to narrow down your analysis to the relevant variables before dropping or imputing missing values.\n",

        "4. Before doing this question, please think for a few minutes about how to make the process of running the following regressions as efficient as possible, before jumping into writing code.

        "      - `held` on `Black` and `sex` and `is_poor` and `prior_F` and `case_type`\n",
        "What happens to the coefficient on the Black dummy variable as you include more regressors/features/controls in the regression? Explain your findings.\n",
        "5. Suppose we don't want to see just `Black` and `sex`, but `Black` interacted with `sex`: Are Black men and Black women treated systemically differently from the rest of the population? Implement this in a regression, and explain your findings.\n",
        "6. Imagine someone argued we should use these kinds of models to help a judge or magistrate make bail decisions (you could obviously go back and make this kind of model for the bond and sentence variables, then deploy it on new cases to predict what their bond and sentence values would be). What concerns would you have? Do you think society should be using data-driven and automated tools like that? Explain your concerns clearly."
